# ember-lit-poc

POC about how to use Lit with Ember/React frameworks.

How to play with it:

1) Go to "component-library" subproject
2) Run "npm run build". It is needed because the "ember-lit-demo" subproject has "component-library" installed as a local npm package.
3) Go to "ember-lit-demo" subproject and run "npm run start"
4) Go to "react-lit-demo" subproject and run "npm run start"
5) Enjoy it
